        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi there! I'm Abby, a college student with a passion for cybersecurity and a love for traveling and sleeping. When it comes to cybersecurity, I'm always eager to learn and expand my knowledge to protect digital assets. Beyond the classroom, I find joy in exploring new destinations around the globe. Whether it's trekking through ancient ruins or lounging on exotic beaches, I'm always up for an adventure. And let's not forget about sleep â€“ there's nothing I love more than sinking into bed after a long day of classes and study sessions. With my laptop in one hand and a travel guide in the other, I'm on a journey to conquer the digital world and explore the wonders of the globe, one cybersecurity challenge and nap at a time.</p>
        <h3 style="font-family:'Courier New'">Future Goals</h3>
        <p>In the coming years, I aspire to become a cybersecurity expert, mastering the field through continuous learning and hands-on experience. Additionally, I'm eager to explore the world, immersing myself in diverse cultures and creating lasting memories through travel. Finally, I aim to make a positive impact by contributing to causes that align with my values, whether through my career, volunteer work, or personal endeavors. Through these goals, I hope to grow professionally, enrich my life with new experiences, and leave a meaningful legacy of positive change.</p>
